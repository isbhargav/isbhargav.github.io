## Description
[UVa 10895 - Matrix Transpose](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=635&page=show_problem&problem=1836)

Problem: Matrix Transpose of sparse Matrix
```
         1   3   2
    A =  0   4  −1
         0   0   0
         5  −2  11

          1   0  0   5
    A' =  3   4  0  −2
          2  −1  0  11
```

### Sample Input
You are given several sparse matrix in a row, each of them described as follows. The first line of the
input corresponds to the dimension of the matrix, m and n (which are the number of rows and columns,
respectively, of the matrix). You are then given m sets of numbers, which represent the rows of the
matrix. Each set consists of two lines which represents a row of the matrix. The first line of a set starts
with the number r, which is the number of non-zero elements in that row, followed by r numbers which
correspond to the column indices of the non-zero elements in that row, in ascending order; the second
line has r integers which are the matrix elements of that row. For example, matrix A above would have
the following representation:

```terminal
4 3
3 1 2 3
1 3 2
2 2 3
4 -1
0

3 1 2 3
5 -2 11

```
### Sample Output
For each input case, the transpose of the given matrix in the same representation.
```terminal
3 4
2 1 4
1 5
3 1 2 4
3 4 -2
3 1 2 4
2 -1 11

```
## Ideas

Store each indices as (row, col, val) then for transpose we just need to flipp it with (col, row, val)


## Solution

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


int main()
{
    int m, n;
    while (scanf("%d %d", &m, &n) != EOF)
    {
        int t = m;
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> mat(m + 1, vector<pair<int, int>>()), matT(n + 1, vector<pair<int, int>>());
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++)
        {
            int a;
            scanf("%d", &a);
            int places[a];
            vector<pair<int, int>> cord;
            for (int i = 0; i < a; i++)
            {
                scanf("%d ", &places[i]);
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < a; i++)
            {
                int b;
                scanf("%d", &b);
                mat[j].push_back({places[i], b});
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < mat[i].size(); j++)
            {
                int p = mat[i][j].first;
                int r = mat[i][j].second;
                int z = i;
                matT[p].push_back({z, r});
            }
        }
        cout << n << " " << m << endl;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        {
            cout << matT[i].size();
            for (int j = 0; j < matT[i].size(); j++)
            {
                cout << " " << matT[i][j].first;
            }
            cout << endl;
            for (int j = 0; j < matT[i].size(); j++)
            {
                if (i == matT[i].size() - 1)
                    cout << matT[i][j].second;
                else
                    cout << matT[i][j].second << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
