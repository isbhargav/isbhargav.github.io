Hi, I'm currently a graduate student at Lakehead University, Thunder Bay. My coursework is mostly realted to Machine Learning and Deep Learning. . However, I'm always curious! I love to learn in general especially a new stack/technology. My focus right now is to learn the most I can in terms of different technologies and specialize later!

I love cs, so I do cs

I am really interested in:

- programming competitions 
- technology
- algorithms & data structures
- ai & machine learning

I am just an enthusiast, but a really motivated one :D

Feel free to message me about anything related to tech, I'm always open to a conversation!
