Hi, I'm currently a graduate student at Lakehead University, Thunder Bay. My coursework is mostly realted to Machine Learning and Deep Learning. . However, I'm always curious! I love to learn in general especially a new stack/technology. My focus right now is to learn the most I can in terms of different technologies and specialize later!

Feel free to message me about anything related to tech, I'm always open to a conversation!
